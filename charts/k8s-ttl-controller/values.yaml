# By default no resource limit and requests will be set. 
# However you can set this by uncommenting the following configuration.
#resources:
#  requests:
#    cpu: 16m
#    memory: 128Mi
#  limits:
#    cpu: 32m
#    memory: 256Mi

# By default, a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
# will be created with complete access. You can however opt to
# create your own ServiceAccount by setting serviceAccount.create
# to false, but it is your responsibility to ensure that the name
# of the ServiceAccount you will create outside of this chart
# matches the name specified in serviceAccount.name.

  name: k8s-ttl-controller
  create: true

# By default, k8s-ttl-controller has access to pretty much everything.
# This is normal, because it has to look at every resource, check for
# an annotation, and if said resource is considered to be outdated,
# it is deleted by the application.
#
# It is however possible to prevent k8s-ttl-controller from interacting
# with certain resources by simply creating a different ClusterRole that
# does not have the required authorization to list and delete said
# resources.
clusterRole:
  create: true

clusterRoleBinding:
  create: true
